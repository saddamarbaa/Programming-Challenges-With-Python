12. Software Sales
A software company sells a package that retails for $99. 
Quantity discounts are given according to the following table:
Quantity      Discount
10_19          10% 
20_49          20% 
50_99          30%
100 or more    40%
Write a program that asks the user to enter the number of packages purchased.
The program should then display the amount of the discount (if any) and the 
total amount of the purchase after the discount.
